Prompts:
1. I have this project:
This is your moment to code with joy, creativity, and purpose using the latest AI-assisted and low-code tools to bring powerful ideas to life! Whether solo or as a team, the mission is simple: build human-centered, joy-driven tech solutions that solve real community challenges. 🌍💡

Agritech: Market Match Platform
Problem: Small-scale farmers lack information about where and when to sell their produce.
Challenge: Create a platform that alerts farmers about local market prices and connects them to nearby buyers or markets.

2. 🛠️ Vibe Coding Tools to Explore
Here’s your tech playground — use any combo of these tools for a fast, fun build!
⚙️ Supabase + Lovable.dev – Auto-generate docs and power your backend

💻 Cursor AI – AI-assisted IDE for code reviews and speed

🎨 MGX – Lightning-fast UI design

📱 Rork.app – Rapid mobile code prototyping (optional)

🚀 Bolt.new – Power-packed like Lovable but stronger

🤖 Claude.ai – Limitless prompt engineering possibilities
3. since you already understand what I'm building can you work on Phase 0: Claude. ai part?
4. Which part do I take to MGX?
5. I have createdthe frontend with claude.ai now I want to connect it to superbase. I have already created the project in superbase. What can I do.
6.generate for me a prompt  to put in germini ai for the frontend.
7. lets not specify the tech stack yet.
8. i WANT A PROMPT FOR THE WHOLE APPLICATION NOT JUST A FARM CARD.
9. Now I need a pitch deck for this project:
